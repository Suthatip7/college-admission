Analysis Tasks: Analyze the historical data and determine the key drivers for admission.

Predictive: 

- Find the missing values. (if any, perform missing value treatment)
- Find outliers (if any, then perform outlier treatment)
- Find the structure of the data set and if required, transform the numeric data type to factor and vice-versa.
- Find whether the data is normally distributed or not. Use the plot to determine the same. 
- Normalize the data if not normally distributed.
- Use variable reduction techniques to identify significant variables.
- Run logistic model to determine the factors that influence the admission process of a student (Drop insignificant variables) 
- Calculate the accuracy of the model and run validation techniques.
- Try other modelling techniques like decision tree and SVM and select a champion model 
- Determine the accuracy rates for each kind of model 
- Select the most accurate model 
- Identify other Machine learning or statistical techniques
